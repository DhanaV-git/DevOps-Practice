<h1> Hello, My Name is Dhanalakshmi Veeramachaneni !!! </h1>
<h1> This is a test for DevOps </h1>
<br>
<h2> Project 1: DevOps test with Tomcat, Jenkins, Git, Maven Completed Successfully </h2>
<h1> Integrating Ansible Testing </h1>
<br>
  <h2> Testing of DevOps with Tomcat, AWS, Jenkins, Git, Ansible, Maven Completed Successfully </h2>
<h3> Integration of Ansible with Jenkins requires the following steps:</h3>
<p> First, add ssh server, ssh pipeline steps in plugin section
<br>
  later add ansadmin details to Jenkins server on Ec2. Followed by Testing the connection of Jenkins and Ansible on Jenkins Post Build execution steps</p>
<br>
Then try to test the configuration. If the test says successful, check the copywarfile.yml in Ansible and make sure all the syntax follows the basic rules.
  <br>
  If needed, change the permissions of playbooks folder. This will help in avoiding permission denied errors in Jenkins Build. Try to build the job now. 
  <br> 95% of time it will run. Try to change as many lines as possible in the Git Code. This might not make any difference, but will help to track the build jobs each time.
</p>
<h2> So far, Simple DevOps Project 2 was completed. But this project needs to be extended for configurations too instead of only copying files in Ansible Playbook </h2>
<br>
<h2> DevOps Simple Project 3: Integrating Tomcat, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Docker. This is part1. Next we will continue with integrating Ansible to this project</h2>
